When the analyst clicks 'Create Incident'
Then an incident is created with attached alert ids and is visible in the Incident list"
MVP-10,IsolationForest v1 scoring service,P2,3d,Unassigned,"Given a saved IsolationForest model artifact
When /score receives a sample feature vector
Then it returns a score [0..1] within 200ms p95 for batch size ≤100"

ADV-01,LLM summarizer for incidents,P2,3d,Unassigned,"Given an incident with ≥3 alerts
When I request a summary
Then the service returns a concise incident narrative with top signals and suggested next steps"
ADV-02,Autoencoder v2 anomaly model,P2,5d,Unassigned,"Given 7 days of labeled features
When the model is trained
Then validation AUC ≥0.80 and inference latency ≤100ms p95"
ADV-03,Playbooks with webhooks,P2,3d,Unassigned,"Given a playbook 'disable user + block IP'
When an incident reaches 'High'
Then the system can trigger outbound webhooks with signed payloads and record execution status"
ADV-04,Multi-tenant RBAC,P1,5d,Unassigned,"Given tenants A and B
When a user from tenant A logs in
Then they cannot access data or alerts from tenant B; roles: viewer/analyst/admin enforced"

When I open the dashboard
Then I see time trends, top users/IPs, and a world map heatlayer of auth sources"
ADV-06,Impossible travel detector (rule+ML),P2,3d,Unassigned,"Given two logins for the same user with implausible travel time
When the detector runs hourly
Then an alert is created with both locations, distance, and confidence score"
ADV-07,Data exfil bytes anomaly detector,P2,3d,Unassigned,"Given 24h of netflow/web bytes_out per host
When the detector runs
Then it flags outliers beyond threshold with baseline stats and host context"
ADV-08,Rare destination/beaconing detector,P2,3d,Unassigned,"Given DNS/HTTP destinations per host
When periodicity or rare-domain heuristics match
Then an alert is created with period score or rarity percentile"
ADV-09,API keys + rate limiting,P2,2d,Unassigned,"Given an API client with a key
When requests exceed 600/min
Then 429 is returned and usage is logged per key"
