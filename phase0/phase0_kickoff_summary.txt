Thanks all — we closed Phase 0 Step 1. Highlights:
- Vision: SIEM-lite + UEBA that ingests auth/network/web logs, detects common threats fast, and gives analysts clear, explainable incidents with one-click triage.
- Personas scenarios: Analyst, Manager, Admin (locked)
- MVP use-cases:
  1. Login brute-force / credential stuffing
  2. Impossible travel
  3. Data exfiltration (bytes anomaly)
  4. Suspicious admin actions (role/privilege changes)
  5. Rare destination / beaconing
- NFR targets: EPS=<250>, Search P95=<2s>, Alert SLA=<60s>, Retention=<7d hot / 30d warm / 90d cold>
- Approver: <Name> (<email>)

Next: I’ll create the MVP/Advanced backlog with acceptance criteria and draft the architecture diagram for review.
